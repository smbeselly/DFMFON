# Script to Coupling Delft3D and MesoFON

# Import the necessary packages

# Initiate the BMI Delft3D

# Read the D3D Domain and Map it to create the 'world' for MesoFON

# Get the limit of the approximated LLWL and build the outer line
# This is as the base for 'salinity approach' to kill the trees that are 
# located outside the allowed area



## Do the first run of Delft3D

# Pause the simulation to a certain delta t coupling (3 months)

## Script to process the output with BMI? or other default Python processing
## package for DFM

## Retrieve the D3DFM map based on WoO
