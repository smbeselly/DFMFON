rem cd to location where you want to do the batch run
rem set the Batch Runner

rem 1. Copy the complete_model.jar to where you want to do the batch run.
rem 2. On the command line, do: jar xf complete_model.jar 

set JAVAREP="C:\Users\sbe002\RepastSimphony-2.8\eclipse\jdk11\bin\java.exe"
set JARREP="C:\Users\sbe002\RepastSimphony-2.8\eclipse\jdk11\bin\jar.exe"

%JARREP% xf complete_model.jar

rem 3. Copy the local_batch_run.properties file into the directory where you 
rem    are doing the batch run.
rem 4. Edit the local_batch_run.properties file if necessary.
rem    You  should only need to edit instance.count and vm.arguments.

rem 5. On the command line do: java -cp "./lib/*" repast.simphony.batch.LocalDriver local_batch_run.properties 
rem    However, the command above is valid for OSX Machine
rem    instead, Try this for Windows

%JAVAREP% -cp lib/* repast.simphony.batch.LocalDriver local_batch_run.properties

rem 6.  On the command line do: 
rem     java -Xmx512m -cp "lib/*" repast.simphony.batch.ClusterOutputCombiner . combined_data 
rem Step 6 will combine the output data from the instance directories into single files.
rem This is not necessary if you run only a single instance.

%JAVAREP% -Xmx512m -cp lib/* repast.simphony.batch.ClusterOutputCombiner . combined_data
