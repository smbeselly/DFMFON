This is a private repo of Delft3D-FM and MesoFON Coupling attempt. This is part of the PhD research by Sebrian Beselly in Monitoring and Modelling Mangrove-Mudflat Dynamics on a Prograding Delta

# What is d3d_meso
In the face of climate change, sea level rise (SLR), increase precipitation certainly affects ecosytem and community therein.
Based on the report of IPCC in 2021, it is certain that the world has been experiencing an increase of temperature up to 1.5C.
That means, the effect of climate change is not negligible.
The rise of sea level is can not be ignored. Several reports has mentioned that several area of Earth has been experiencing SLR.
In response to that, we should investigate what kind of countermeasure that is sustainable for long run yet safe for all of the ecosystem.
Several research have shown how vegetation is dynamically adapt to sea level change. e.g., salt marsh and mangrove.
However, research that investigates the role of mangrove to sea level change is not yet understood.
In this research we attempt to understand how individual mangrove trees respond the environmental forces, e.g., wave force, tidal circulation, and sediment transport.

Here, we are trying to couple the state-of-the-art hydro-morphodynamic model Delft3D Flexible Mesh and an individual-based mangrove model MesoFON.
The output of this coupling project is the dynamic interactions up to the individual level of mangroves to environmental changes.
